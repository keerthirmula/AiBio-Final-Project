# AiBio-Final-Project
Final Project, choose own data, make a model
Hi, lemme know if you can see this

For the project, you can largely pick what you want to do. Essentially, select some data that can be analyzed with AI and work to make a notebook that walks through the process of analyzing the data.

## Data sources: 
Your own data

Kaggle

UCI Machine Learning Repository***

NASA Earth Data

Google Dataset Search


## Make a notebook that has these sections:

Introduction: Describe the data and where you got the data. Describe the question being answered and the method(s) being used to answer the question.

Data pre-processing: What's needed to load the data, clean the data, normalize, etc.

Model setup: Setup one or more models

Hyperparameter tuning: Do some playing with the model hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, batch size, epochs, whatever makes sense)

Results: How did the model do

Discussion: Summarize what worked, what didn't etc.


## Selected Dataset 
From UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository 

Mushroom
,Donated on 4/26/1987
,From Audobon Society Field Guide; mushrooms described in terms of physical characteristics; classification: poisonous or edible

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom

"This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525).  Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended.  This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.  The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ``leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy."
